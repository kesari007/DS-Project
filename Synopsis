TECHNICAL DETAILS

The program WAR CARD GAME 	has been made on cpp language.

It uses different aspects of cpp language as it uses the object oriented feature of cpp 

programming consisting of various classes and objects.These classes are used in
  
the program to create various constructors and methods for setting cards, getting
 
value,display etc. Also it has used the cpp STL(Standard Template Library) for its 

 efficient use.The most used Data Structure in our program is the the Array used to 

 store the values of different cards efficiently.
